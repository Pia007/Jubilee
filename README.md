## Overview

### The Project

Jubilee

This is brief history of Juneteenth.  This is my very first Passion Project.  I started this project because I wanted to have a better understanding of the history of Juneteenth.  The project is by no means exhaustive with dynamic details.  It is merely intent to act a a guide to begin research and an exercise in Frontend Development.
